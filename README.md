#### Behavior Tree Aquarium Example

The Aquarium Example demonstrates how to create behavior tree projects for Jibo. The example also demonstrates one way to create GUI elements and animation using Pixies and PixiFlash. This approach leverages an Adobe Creative Cloud-based workflow that will be familiar to many interactive content developers.
